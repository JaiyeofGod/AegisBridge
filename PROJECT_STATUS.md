## 3. Approved Decisions (Phase 0)

- Complete Phase 0 before Phase 1 (**Option A**)
- Tooling: **pnpm**, **uv**, **Pyright**, **Prettier**
- Early dev: Compose for Postgres/Redis/Valkey/SeaweedFS; **host-run** React + FastAPI
- Celery: minimal foundation, no meaningful jobs yet
- Routes: `/signin`, `/account/workspace`
- Post-bootstrap UI: real Figma Sign-in + Overview
- Figma access available

---

## 4. Blockers for Phase 1

**Minimal Phase 0 gate:** complete. Phase 1 may start after explicit approval.

Still verify at Phase 1 start:

- Docker available on Mac
- Node 24 LTS and Python 3.14.x installable
- Package version availability for React 19.3 / Vite 8 on Apple Silicon

---

## 5. What Not To Do Until Phase 1 Is Approved

- Do not scaffold React or FastAPI until Phase 1 authorization
- Do not install application packages during Phase 0
- Do not download datasets, install Wazuh, or fabricate evidence
